# Python-libraries

A comprehensive list of some important python libraries

1. [Tensor Flow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)--for building and deploying ML powered applications.
2. [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) - NumPy is the fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python.
3. [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) - SciPy is open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.
4. [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python, providing labeled data structures similar to R data.frame objects, statistical functions, and much more.
5. [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests) - Python HTTP Requests for Humans.
6. [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) - Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication-quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.

Java
======

1. [Dozer](https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer) - Mapper that copies data from one object to another using annotations and API or XML configuration.
2. [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Declarative build and dependency management that favors convention over configuration. It might be preferable to Apache Ant, which uses a rather procedural approach and can be difficult to maintain.
3. [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - Incremental builds programmed via Groovy instead of declaring XML. Works well with Maven's dependency management.
